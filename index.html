                <p>Transport, or transportation is the movement of humans, animals and goods from one location to
                    another. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations. Transport enables
                    trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations.</p>

                <p>Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways,
                    waterways, canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations,
                    warehouses, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations) and

                    of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.</p>

                <p>Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an area for landing. The
                    majority of aircraft also need an airport with the infrastructure to receive maintenance,
                    restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. </p>

                <p>Rail transport is where a train runs along a set of two parallel steel rails, known as a railway or
                    railroad. The rails are anchored perpendicular to ties (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel,
                    to maintain a consistent distance apart, or gauge. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a
                    foundation made of concrete or compressed earth and gravel in a bed of ballast.</p>

                <p>Water transport is movement by means of a watercraft—such as a barge, boat, ship or sailboat—over a
                    body of water, such as a sea, ocean, lake, canal or river. The need for buoyancy is common to
                    watercraft, making the hull a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.</p>
